# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

A cool Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a couple of extra functions.

How it works:
In the beginning of each round the program asks the user to choose rock, paper or scissor and then the program compares the user's choice to the computer's choice and decides who wins the round. The user can follow the score and the number of rounds played on the scoreboard. Once the user is done playing, the program show the total score and rounds.
